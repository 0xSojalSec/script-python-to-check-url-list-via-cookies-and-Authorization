script python to check url list via cookies and Authorization

I wrote this Python script myself
I was working on a special program for hackerone so I needed this script to see which links worked more than 10,000 links
I used this method when I needed authorization and cookies

You may ask why I found xss but it doesn't work completely. I think I have to open the file elsewhere and then it will be reflected so you can use it for your other projects

don't forget change num_threads,/xx/xxx/Users/xxxxx/Desktop/1.txt ,
headers = {
    "Authorization": "Basic "
}

cookies = {
    "cookie_name": ""
}
